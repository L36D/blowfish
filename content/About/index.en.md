# A loner
## Family, humanity, fraternity
There is a saying in English that familial bonds are always stronger than other relationships. That is "blood is thicker than water".

I, however, do not agree with this. There is no way to even trust anyone, not even our family since they cannot provide trustness and love forever. Even if we agree with this, our (closest) family would and should be extended towards humanity, not solely on a particular group you live with. That's why, we are all cousins, even if we are strangers. But if we include this view, by confirming the proverb there is no way to even trust anyone.

Btw, I have very weak family ties.

## Friendship as true love
The truth above all these appearences lies in the lies of tradition.

Every human being love to be loved. Whatever love is, it is the true beauty behind all the things we love, it is the only one who loves itself and be loved itself. It is so perfect that the only thing it can do, is to love itself. From love derives everything.
